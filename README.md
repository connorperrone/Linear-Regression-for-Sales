# Linear Regression for Sales

This program uses linear regression to create a mathematical model allowing the user to estimate future sales.

The Method of Least Squares is used to create the model based on the sales data provided by the user.

Once the model is created, the user can visualize the line of best fit and estimate sales in future years.

The program uses the user's data and the linear model to generate a graph with the [QuickChart](https://quickchart.io/) API.

### Console menu allowing the user to:
- Add data for a sale
- Remove data for a sale
- List existing sales data
- Calculate linear model
- Get line of best fit graph URL
- Estimate sales for future year
- Exit
